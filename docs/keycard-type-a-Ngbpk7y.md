the reader beeps loudly, the light on it turning green, and the door slides into the wall. with the whir of machinery, it shuts behind you after you enter, the keycard reader on this side blinking back to red. the room is painted a light green, and the table is empty except for an old-style wired telephone. the landline wire in the back is snapped, and the speaker is humming blankly. the voicemail button is blinking, and when you press it, it announces that there's 1 opened voicemail from july 6th, 2114, and it begins.<span class='doc'>"this is director gerald, over a matter of critical importance. we just received an intelligence report that the united kingdom is investigating the leaked documents, and is considering taking serious action based on their contents. please brief the president and set up a call between the three of us and the other joint chiefs so we can discuss this further as soon as possible. downplaying this as a conspiracy won't work anymore."</span>the voicemail ends and offers an option to repeat it. there's nothing else in here.
