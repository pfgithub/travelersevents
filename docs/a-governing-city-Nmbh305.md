rather than towering skyscrapers, the city ahead is comprised of massive structures that stay low to the ground. separated by many long fields and pits in the earth that must have once been lakes, the old buildings are supported by numerous columns, with highly detailed decorations sculpted into every inch of the stone they're built from. none are more than a few stories tall, but they bear an ancient strength, resisting the powerful winds that would wither a more modern tower. the path ahead leads to one of the great stone edifices, punctured by a tunnel straight through the center, continuing toward the sprawling fields beyond. there's a flicker of movement behind one of the many windows, but after focusing on it for a few minutes, nothing further happens.
