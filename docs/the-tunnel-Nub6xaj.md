# the tunnel

Seen 1 time

it's now pitch black, the little existing light now totally absorbed. you trail a hand on the wall to keep track of where you are, rubbing mud off as you go. after a few minutes, your hand collides with a cold metal box fixed to the side of the tunnel. feeling at it, you realize it opens, and your hand rests on what feels like a lever.

**If Req Met**: it's now pitch black, the little existing light now totally absorbed. there's a strange scent in the air, one of burnt metal and concrete.
