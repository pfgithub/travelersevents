# a cardboard box (Looting)

Seen 11 times. Last seen ??.

in spite of the dying world, the box is clean, and still might have something left.

**Visited**: the box has been slightly folded with fresh creases. someone's looked inside already.

## Example Loot:

- +1 scrap metal (<code>รฐ</code>)  
  a few shards of metal. probably can be bent into useful shapes.  
  **weight**: 2 units

## Buttons:

- **loot**: [Travel](Travel-travel.md)
- **leave**: I have not gone this way yet.
