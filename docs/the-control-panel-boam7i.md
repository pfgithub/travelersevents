you twist a few buttons and switch a few levers, and for a moment nothing happens, but suddenly the basement begins to rumble. a few of the pipes burst from the movement, and after a moment, the rumbling stops. you look around and notice that a section of the wall in the other corner of the room has slid away, revealing an area beyond.

- **the restricted access door**: I have not gone this way yet.
- **back upstairs**: I have not gone this way yet.
