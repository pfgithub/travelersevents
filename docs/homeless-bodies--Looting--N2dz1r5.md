Seen 1 time

in death, they can no longer hide and protect that which was theirs.

## Example Loot:

- +2 syringe (<code>=-</code>)  
  intended for injecting liquids into a bloodstream.  
  **weight**: 3 units

## Buttons:

- **loot**: [the buried platform](the-buried-platform-N7cubv2.md)
- **leave**: I have not gone this way yet.
