long seats are covered in sheetrock and glass from the collapsed ceiling above. a wooden altar stands above the room with a big and withered book on it. behind this is a fixture of a starved man with his arms outstretched, his wrists and feet driven through with nails to crossed wooden beams.

## Buttons:

- **the book**: [a withered book](a-withered-book-nn8ete.md)
- **leave**: I have not gone this way yet.
