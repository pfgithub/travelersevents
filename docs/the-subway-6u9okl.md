# the subway

Seen 1 time

as you descend the staircase, you notice the air grow extremely still. the stale atmosphere feels almost like wading through a liquid. the tiles lining the walls and floor are filthy, and the path continues down until you arrive at a platform with a single subway track. the train is not here, and one side of the tunnel, the ceiling has caved in and blocked the way.

- **the railway**: [the tunnel](the-tunnel-Nub6xaj.md)
- **go back**: I have not gone this way yet.
