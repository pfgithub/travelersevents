# the gap

you're greeted by another staircase, and you descend far deeper than before. the new area is expansive and dark, so much so that you can't see more than a few meters around. after walking forward for several seconds, you can just barely make out a large lever against the wall. at its base is a rotten wooden box, its lid closed.

- **pull the lever**: I have not gone this way yet.
- **check wood box**: [a rotten wood box](a-rotten-wood-box-kzyjbi.md)
