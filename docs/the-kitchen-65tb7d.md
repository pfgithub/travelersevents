the kitchen is small, complete with only a few rotted chairs around a fallen table and a refrigerator. it's still humming, power somehow still reaching it after all this time, but the door hangs open, revealing an empty interior. the freezer door has alphabet magnets on it, a few of them spelling "we miss you mom". there's a door leading to the backyard.
