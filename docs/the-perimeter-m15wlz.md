it's clear why the wire fence was here; climbing over all the intersecting pipes and machinery proves to be more difficult than it seemed. after a while you arrive at a road, pipes still reaching overhead. one path leads left to an opening in the fence, toward the city. to the right is what appears to be the main entrance.
