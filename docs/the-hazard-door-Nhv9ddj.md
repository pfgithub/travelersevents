# the hazard door

Seen 11 times

this door isn't locked, and creaks open to reveal a descending staircase. the metal steps ache as you go down, the light slowly being swallowed by the darkness. as you reach the bottom, the lights in this area flicker on as well, but these are a deep red. there's more intertwined pipes down here, most leaking black liquids onto the floor, pumping what little oil manages to run through them. the brick walls are shining with moisture, and to one side is a panel of machinery, its buttons lit and blinking. there's a door in the back corner, as well, labeled "authorized personnel only".

**If Req Met**: the metal steps ache as you go down, the light slowly being swallowed by the darkness. there's more intertwined pipes down here, most leaking black liquids onto the floor, pumping what little oil manages to run through them. in one corner is a gap in the wall, its bottom flooded with water. there's a door in the back corner, as well, labeled "authorized personnel only".
