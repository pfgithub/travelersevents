# the safe (Looting)

Seen 1 time. Last seen ??.

the hinges creak surprisingly loudly for such a small thing.

## Example Loot:

- +1 keycard type a (<code>[a]</code>)  
  it describes itself as a security clearance card, with access limited to "group a".  
  **weight**: 1 units

## Buttons:

- **loot**: [the ruined office](the-ruined-office-Nnkh4ub.md)
- **leave**: I have not gone this way yet.
