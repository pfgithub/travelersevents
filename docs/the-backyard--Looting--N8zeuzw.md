a toy car is overturned in the dirt, ash layered on top of it. there's an open shed, mostly empty.

## Example Loot:

  a few shards of metal. probably can be bent into useful shapes.  
  **weight**: 2 units
- +3 cloth (<code>c</code>)  
  tattered and partially rotted fabric, but combined with others like it, could still be put to use.  
  **weight**: 1 units
