# the doomsday bunker

Seen 2 times. Last seen ??.

the percussive blast goes off, thundering through the bunker as the man's blood paints the shelf and wall behind him. his body falls to the ground, the shotgun clattering away. after a moment to breathe, you step over the body and open the other two doors. the one closer to the bed is a closet filled with cans; most empty, but still plenty full of various foods. a dozen broken can openers litter the carpeted floor. in the other door is a tiny bathroom, with a shower and toilet. the television, when activated, starts playing an old movie. there's a journal on a shelf next to the bed, now soaking with blood.
