a small lobby, containing only an empty desk pushed against the wall, is met only by a long hallway straight ahead. there's a metal door behind the desk, but its scanner has been destroyed, and its seam welded shut.

## Buttons:

- **the hallway**: [blinking scanners](blinking-scanners-Nxt52i3.md)
- **leave**: I have not gone this way yet.
