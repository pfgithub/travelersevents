Seen ?? times. Last seen ??.

most of the pages talk simply about the media he experienced on his television that day, repeatedly emphasizing how writing it down helped keep him from going insane. but every few weeks, a note is written about witnessing people walking around outside his bunker. thin, muscular people with gaunt faces in tattered clothes who walk from horizon to horizon without stopping. he repeatedly wrote how he's terrified of them, and if one ever finds him, he would kill it without hesitation. after only a hundred pages, the blood has soaked too far through to read earlier in the man's life.
