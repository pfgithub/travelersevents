the colorful walls have faded with time, the tiles cracked by whoever once made a stand here. barbed wire surrounds the entrance inside, but it's easy to pick through when there's no one actively defending it. a few starved corpses rest on the ground with rotted and rusted weapons over their chests, surrounded by empty canned goods.
