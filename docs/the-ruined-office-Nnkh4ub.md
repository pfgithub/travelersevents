an office room is covered in shards of glass, shattered inward from where windows used to be. blood coats the wall behind the desk, and a dead body, its flesh withered away, is sprawled against the chair without a head. in its limp arms, a shotgun rests, its wood rotted and metal rusted. on top of the desk is a short handwritten note.<span class='doc'>they found me. i see the lights of their cars outside my office. forgive me that i had to leave you all this way. i hope you can find someone else to supply you. don't let them win.</span>it might be worth a look around to see if anything is left.
