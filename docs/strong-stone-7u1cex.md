# strong stone

Seen 301 times

the tunnel is decorated by sculptures of ancient humans in disorderly robes, its walls carved with flowers and nature. the ash hasn't reached too far into this tunnel, preserving a lot of the decor. at the center of the tunnel are two staircases leading high into the building. the one on the left is broken and covered in debris, but the one on the right is intact.
