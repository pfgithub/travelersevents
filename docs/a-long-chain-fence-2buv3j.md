barbed wire tops a chain-link fence that stretches for hundreds of feet in either direction, surrounding a hunkering concrete building embedded in the ground. a flag pole reaches for the sky in front of the dark structure, a tattered red and blue flag hanging loosely from its peak. the fence meets in the middle as a wide gate, its hinges far enough apart to allow larger vehicles through. the two ends are chained together and held by a large padlock.

**If Req Met**: barbed wire tops a chain-link fence that stretches for hundreds of feet in either direction, surrounding a hunkering concrete building embedded in the ground. a flag pole reaches for the sky in front of the dark structure, a tattered red and blue flag hanging loosely from its peak. the fence meets in the middle as a wide gate, its hinges far enough apart to allow larger vehicles through. it's been opened barely wide enough to let a person through, a snapped padlock resting on the ground before it.
