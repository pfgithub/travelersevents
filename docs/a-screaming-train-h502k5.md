# a screaming train

Seen 1 time

you turn heel and sprint, tearing down the tunnel as the subway speeds at you, and in the light of the overhead lamps, you spot a gap in the wall. ducking inside, you squeeze yourself against the tiny amount of extra room this gap affords you, before finally the train blows past. you step out, and looking back, and you watch as the train collides with the rubble at the original platform, an ear-shattering crash echoing through the dark tunnel before fading back to dead silence.
