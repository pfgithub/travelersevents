you continue down the long tunnel and are greeted by an entrance to a new platform, filled with an orange flickering light. a trash can is aflame in the center, with corpses in warm clothes strewn around it. these bodies are fairly fresh, hidden away down here, not having succumbed to decomposition like the rest of the world.
