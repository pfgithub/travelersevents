a human corpse hangs from the ceiling by a rope around its neck, ripped clothes hanging off its rotted skin. there's a bed in here as well, and next to it a nightstand with a dead clock and a small note. it reads:<span class='doc'>to whoever finds me, i'm sorry. i was weak. they took everything. they took our children from us. who could want to go on in a world like this? i just want to see the sky again. i'm out of food, and i can't even feed my dog. i'd rather take my own life before i grow hungry enough to consider eating her. if there's a light at the end of the tunnel, forgive me for running out of strength before i could find it.</span>there's nothing else in here.
