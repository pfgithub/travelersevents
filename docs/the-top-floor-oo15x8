# the top floor

the stairs creak loudly, echoing through the gaping hole in the roof. the walls separating the rooms have fallen away to mere rubble. there's a trash bag in the back corner of all the mess, covered in the ash that coats the rest of this area. maybe there's something someone didn't need.

- **search**: [an old trash bag](an-old-trash-bag-hamcoi)
- **leave**: I have not gone this way yet.
