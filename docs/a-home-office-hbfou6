# a home office

the back wall has been ripped from the rest of the room, resting in a pile of debris where the rest of the house used to be. there's a computer in here on a desk, still plugged into the wall. somehow it still receives power, the monitor lit and awake.

- **the computer**: [the computer](the-computer-Nbqmiwv)
- **leave**: I have not gone this way yet.
