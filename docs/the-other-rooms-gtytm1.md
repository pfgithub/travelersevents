# the other rooms

Seen 15 times. Last seen ??.

each room is a different color, with walls plastered with historical facts, simple math, or english phrases. even in the dark, with little escaping through the windows, the bright colors are a stark contrast to the rest of the world. the desks are still organized, the chairs still in order. the boards on the walls have been wiped clean. there's still toys and instruments and writing utensils in these rooms, but otherwise nothing useful.
