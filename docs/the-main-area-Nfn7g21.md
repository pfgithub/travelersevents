# the main area

Seen 20 times. Last seen ??.

the dusty tiles emit clouds as you step over them. there's a rotten wood desk in front of a wall that looks like it once held a logo; despite seeming to be the main entrance, the area is not grand or well-presented. this was a place for work, not grand advertising gestures. glass double doors leading out of the building let a little of the atmosphere's light in ahead. there's two staircases to either side, but both have withered over time, making the upper levels inaccessible. across the room from the main desk is a maintenance closet, and a door labeled with a hazard symbol.
