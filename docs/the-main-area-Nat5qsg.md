you slide the glass entrance open, and are greeted by deep darkness, broken only by some dim light escaping through the ceiling in the distance. running your hands along the wall, you find a switch and activate it. the lights overhead flicker on, washing the room in an eerie green, and the refinery comes to life as an emergency generator kicks on in the distance, humming intensely. there's a rotten wood desk in front of a wall that looks like it once held a logo; despite seeming to be the main entrance, the area is not grand or well-presented. this was a place for work, not grand advertising gestures. there's two staircases to either side, but both have withered over time, making the upper levels inaccessible. across the room from the main desk is a maintenance closet, and a door labeled with a hazard symbol. there's also an opening that leads to an area with many pipes and different machines.
